# Extended-kalman-filter
Kalman Filter for linear systems and extend it to a nonlinear system such as a self-driving car. Apply the Kalman Filter on the data received by IMU, LIDAR and GPS and estimate the co-ordinates of a self-driving car and visualize its real trajectory versus the ground truth trajectory
